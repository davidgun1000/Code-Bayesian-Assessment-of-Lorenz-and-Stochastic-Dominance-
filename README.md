# Code-Bayesian-Assessment-of-Lorenz-and-Stochastic-Dominance-
Code for Bayesian Assessment of Lorenz and stochastic dominance

This is the code for the paper "Bayesian assessement of Lorenz and stochastic dominance"
David Gunawan, William Griffiths, and Duangkamon Chotikapanich (2020) Canadian Journal of Economics, 53 (2), 767-799.
The main code is dominance_prog_gamma.m.
The main code will generate the posterior probabilities of Lorenz and stochastic dominance. 
Please read the paper for more information.
The user needs to supply their own data.
It requires a .mat file with two variables, one for the income variable and one for the sampling weight.
